# About Me: Ang Ming Yang
I am a Computer Engineering NTU Student Graduating in 2027 May. 
I Enjoy Programming, Learning New Things and finding anomalies in other's code.

Coding, Networks and Cybersecurity are waht intrigues me.

A Fun Fact about me is that ive met my NTU's Cyber Security vice director over one of discoveries about the NTU Elearning platform.
Although My discovery turned out to be a false flag, it was still an interesting experience.
